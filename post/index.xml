The aim of this explorative research was to use an eyetracker to analyze different behavioral patterns over longer periods for two participants without creating laboratory conditions. This setup was consciously chosen so that we could test the robustness of the assertions under natural conditions. Here, we analyzed the pupil diameter, the position on the screen, and the position of the head relative to the display while recording which software applications the participants used and event data for the respective applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
